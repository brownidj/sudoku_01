Create a single cute cartoon ape head in a polished, kid-friendly mobile game icon style. The ape should have a rounded face, big expressive glossy eyes, and a friendly smile. Include small rounded ears, a slightly lighter tan face/muzzle area, and a simple hair cap/tuft on top. Use thick clean dark outlines, smooth gradient shading, and a subtle 3D “sticker” look with gentle inner highlights. Keep details minimal and clean, with warm browns and tans.
Output: ape head only, centered, no text, no grid, no frame, no numbers, no other animals, transparent background (PNG), high resolution, crisp edges.

    "dolphin": """
Create a single cute cartoon dolphin (head-and-upper-body or full simplified dolphin) in a polished, kid-friendly mobile game icon style. The dolphin should have a smooth rounded silhouette, big glossy eye, and a friendly open smile with a tiny hint of tongue (optional). Use a bright ocean-blue palette with soft gradient shading and clean highlight bands to give a smooth 3D sticker look.

BASE_PROMPT = """
Using DALL-E, create a simple, clean line-drawing illustration of a {animal}'s face,
three-quarter-facing to the right and centered.

Use smooth, confident black outlines with minimal detail.
Apply a small amount of flat, muted colour only where appropriate
(e.g. ears, nose, markings), avoiding gradients or shading.

The style should be modern, neutral expression, and icon-like —
suitable for educational materials or UI icons.
Transparent background.

Emphasise clear shapes, symmetry, recognisable features,
anatomically recognisable features, restrained colour palette.

No photorealism.
No shading or gradients.
No complex textures.
No background scenes.
No text or watermark.
No sketchy lines or cross-hatching.
No realism or heavy textures.
